## BitcoinD Ruby Container

A Ruby Container with:

- Debian wheezy
- (almost) latest Ruby
- bitcoind
- a proejct with the following ruby gems already bundled

- vim already preconfigured (awesome config - one command install - with all the themes, snippets, cursor and stuff - or a barebone vim just with syntax higlighting - need help from a VI user, if you are one, please fork :) )


Oh and the real readme (install/run instructions) is/are not here...
